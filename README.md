## Pulling to a new machine

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/whazzmaster/vimrc.git ~/.vim
    ```

2. Pull Vundle down into the bundle directory

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    ```

3. Open vim and run `:PluginInstall`

4. It's Miller Time
